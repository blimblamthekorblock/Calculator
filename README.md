# Calculator
Experimenting with creating a calculator to facilitate dec to hex and backwards conversions while calculating.

Left input box should receive decimal numbers and simple operations. Right input box is the same but using hexadecimal.
The content from left should be copied to right and vice versa on user input.
Current operations should be limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Values should be limited to uint64.

Potential changes:
- Parantheses
- Editing lines to recalculate
- Bitmasks
- Horizontal input boxes
- Numbers should be separated by spaces to simplify the code.
